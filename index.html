<p>JSHARP  is  otherwise known  as JDollarSHARP is  invented  in JDollar ProgrammingLanguage  by wilmix jemin j;  but  it  is   used only  in  unix  type  os. </p>

<p>JSHARP  is  otherwise known  as JDollarSHARP is  invented  in JDollar   ProgrammingLanguage  by wilmix jemin j;  but  it  is   used only  in  unix  type  os. </p>

<p>It  consists of modules  like  w++,oplus,o$,vslash,S@,o$,jhsf,mybatics,

<p>Note: Here we  use only   JAVA/J2ee technology with  JAVA runtime.</p>

<p>and  Remoteserver  and  this  ProgrammingLanguage  is  invented in JDollar Technology.</p>

<p>JSHARP  will  run   only  in SLING  os  or  GALAXYOS </p>

<p>Since  java class  file  code  is  seen  using  JAD.</p>

<p>JAVA  class file is  converted  to .wl class file  format.</p>

<p>which  can't be read by hackers.</p>

<p>The  MAJOR  modules   used are</p>
